Father figures we are 
You're a shooting star you've come so far
I was once in your shoes 
In a closet like you
I had nothing to lose

Hey man gay man pick up the soap 
Get on your knees and pray
Hey man gay man
Release your load
You've got to cease to delay
The gay way

It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
Hooray! For the man!

Ooh, strong man
queen of the balls 
some brotherly love is a pleasure for all
Come out
open your eyes
it's a matter of size

Hey man gay man pick up the soap 
Get on your knees and pray
Hey man gay man 
Release your load 
you've got to cease to delay 
The gay way

It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Okay to be gay!
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way

Sing hallelujah (sing hallelujah)
It's getting to ya (it's getting to ya)

Hey! Ho! Mo! Hey! Ho! Mo! Hey! Ho!
Now remember 
There's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over

It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
It's okay!
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way

West is where you should go 
To San Francisco
I get that you know 
Would you gather my face
So united we stand in a gay parade
A human serenade

Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
It's okay to be gay, let's rejoice with the boys in the gay way
Hooray for the kind of man that you will find in the gay way
It's okay to be gay!
